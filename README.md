# Jhipster

This application was generated using JHipster 6.10.5 and JHipster .Net Core 2.1.0, you can find documentation and help at [https://www.jhipster.tech/documentation-archive/v6.10.5](https://www.jhipster.tech/documentation-archive/v6.10.5).

## Development

Before you can build this project, you must install and configure the following dependencies on your machine:

1. [Node.js][]: We use Node to run a development web server and build the project.
   Depending on your system, you can install Node either from source or as a pre-packaged bundle.

After installing Node, you should be able to run the following command to install development tools.
You will only need to run this command when dependencies change in [package.json](package.json).

In ./src/Jhipster/ClientApp run

    npm install

We use npm scripts and [Webpack][] as our build system.

Run the following commands in two separate terminals to create a blissful development experience where your browser
auto-refreshes when files change on your hard drive.

    dotnet run --verbosity normal --no-restore --project ./src/Jhipster/Jhipster.csproj
    npm --prefix ./src/Jhipster/ClientApp start

To determine which process is running, you can use the powershell command:

	get-nettcpconnection | where {($_.State -eq "Listen") -and ($_.RemoteAddress -eq "0.0.0.0")} | Select LocalAddress,LocalPort,RemoteAddress,RemotePort,State,OwningProcess | ft

npm is also used to manage CSS and JavaScript dependencies used in this application. You can upgrade dependencies by
specifying a newer version in [package.json](package.json). You can also run `npm update` and `npm install` to manage dependencies.
Add the `help` flag on any command to see how you can use it. For example, `npm help update`.

The `npm --prefix ./src/Jhipster/ClientApp run` command will list all of the scripts available to run for this project.

### Service workers

Service workers are commented by default, to enable them please uncomment the following code.

- The service worker registering script in index.html

```html
<script>
  if ('serviceWorker' in navigator) {
    navigator.serviceWorker.register('./service-worker.js').then(function () {
      console.log('Service Worker Registered');
    });
  }
</script>
```

Note: workbox creates the respective service worker and dynamically generate the `service-worker.js`

### Managing dependencies

For example, to add [Leaflet][] library as a runtime dependency of your application, you would run following command:

    npm --prefix ./src/Jhipster/ClientApp install --save --save-exact leaflet

To benefit from TypeScript type definitions from [DefinitelyTyped][] repository in development, you would run following command:

    npm --prefix ./src/Jhipster/ClientApp install --save-dev --save-exact @types/leaflet

Then you would import the JS and CSS files specified in library's installation instructions so that [Webpack][] knows about them:
Edit [Jhipster/ClientApp/app/vendor.ts](Jhipster/ClientApp/app/vendor.ts) file:

```
import 'leaflet/dist/leaflet.js';
```

Edit [Jhipster/ClientApp/content/css/vendor.css](Jhipster/ClientApp/content/css/vendor.css) file:

```
@import '~leaflet/dist/leaflet.css';
```

Note: there are still few other things remaining to do for Leaflet that we won't detail here.

For further instructions on how to develop with JHipster, have a look at [Using JHipster in development][].

### Using angular-cli

You can also use [Angular CLI][] to generate some custom client code.

For example, the following command:

    ng generate component my-component

will generate few files:

    create Jhipster/ClientApp/src/app/my-component/my-component.component.html
    create Jhipster/ClientApp/src/app/my-component/my-component.component.ts
    update Jhipster/ClientApp/src/app/app.module.ts

## Building for production

To build the arifacts and optimize the Jhipster application for production, run:

    cd ./src/Jhipster
    rm -rf ./src/Jhipster/wwwroot
    dotnet publish --verbosity normal -c Release -o ./app/out ./Jhipster.csproj

The `./src/Jhipster/app/out` directory will contain your application dll and its depedencies.

This will concatenate and minify the client CSS and JavaScript files. It will also modify `index.html` so it references these new files.

## Code style / formatting

To format the dotnet code, run

    dotnet format

## Testing

To launch your application's tests, run:

    dotnet test --verbosity normal

### Client tests

In ClientApp folder run :

    npm test

### Code quality

By Script :

1. Run Sonar in container : `docker-compose -f ./docker/sonar.yml up -d`

2. Wait container was up Run `SonarAnalysis.ps1` and go to http://localhost:9001

Manually :

1. Run Sonar in container : `docker-compose -f ./docker/sonar.yml up -d`

2. Install sonar scanner for .net :

`dotnet tool install --global dotnet-sonarscanner`

3. Run `` dotnet sonarscanner begin /d:sonar.login=admin /d:sonar.password=admin /k:"Jhipster" /d:sonar.host.url="http://localhost:9001" /s:"`pwd`/SonarQube.Analysis.xml" ``

4. Build your application : `dotnet build`

5. Publish sonar results : `dotnet sonarscanner end /d:sonar.login=admin /d:sonar.password=admin`

6. Go to http://localhost:9001

### Monitoring

1. Run container (uncomment chronograf and kapacitor if you would use it): `docker-compose -f ./docker/monitoring.yml up -d`

2. Go to http://localhost:3000 (or http://localhost:8888 if you use chronograf)

3. (Only for chronograf) Change influxdb connection string by `YourApp-influxdb`

4. (Only for chronograf) Change kapacitor connection string by `YourApp-kapacitor`

5. (Only for chronograf) You can now add dashboard (like docker), see your app log in Cronograf Log viewer and send alert with kapacitor

## Build a Docker image

You can also fully dockerize your application and all the services that it depends on. To achieve this, first build a docker image of your app by running:

    docker build -f ./src/Jhipster/Dockerfile -t Jhipster .

Then run:

    docker run -p 80:80 Jhipster
